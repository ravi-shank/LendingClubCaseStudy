# Lending club case study

## General Information
The main objective of this exercise is to help Lending Club reduce credit losses. This challenge stems from two possible scenarios:​

- Identifying applicants who are likely to repay their loans is essential, as they can generate profits for the company through interest payments. Rejecting these applicants would mean missing out on potential business opportunities.​

- Conversely, approving loans for applicants who are unlikely to repay and pose a risk of default can lead to significant financial losses for the company.​
